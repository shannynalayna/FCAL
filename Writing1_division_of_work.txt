CSCI 3081W Writing Assignment 1 Division of Labor Statement
Tristan Mansfield
Shannyn Telander

	For this writing project, Tristan fixed the errors in the code for problems 2, 5, and 6, and wrote the corresponding paragraphs detailing these problems in the paper. Shannyn did the same for problems 1, 3, and 4. The intro was written by Shannyn and the conclusion was written by Tristan. We both proofread all of the writing and made sure all of the code was working properly before submitting.
